# _{Pierre's Bakery: My Eighth Code Review at Epicodus}_

#### By Zachary Green

#### _{This application demonstrates classes and namespaces in C# and how to use MSTest to test all code. Under the mentorship and guidance of Epicodus: https://www.epicodus.com/}_

## Technologies Used
* C#
* MStest

## Description

_{This application is a Bakery where the user can buy a bread or pastries. Tell Pierre how many loafs of bread you want or patries. The user will get back the total price of their order. Application uses 2 Classes with their own seperate logic that are called into the main Program file via a namespace. This is a demonstration of the power of namespaces in C#. All testing in this program is done using MSTest to ensure all expeced resuts are coming from the built out logic.}_
